No submission for task 1. Did you forget to upload?

Added feedback for delayed submission:
1 (a): (3.5 pts) out of 6
You calculated V(S_2,5) in 1st episode. It's not right. You already received 10 on transition from (2,4) to (2,5). So, G_t for S_2,5 would not be calculated, as there is no transition from S_2,5 and therefore no R_t+1.
Similar mistake for V(S_3,3) in 2nd episode and V(S_2,5) in 3rd.
Calculation mistakes in 3rd episode. You did 97*6, it should be 97*3. Similar mistakes later.
You calculated V(S_2,4) 2 times. That's wrong. It's 1st visit MC. 1st visit value was correctly calculated.

1 (b): (1.5 pts) out of 2
Because of previous mistakes, the 1st TD error is wrong.
You didn't need to calculate 'V's in 1(b).
Wrong calculation for delta_t for V(S_1,5): you added -1 which was not needed. Extra calculation for delta_t for V(S_2,5). This leads to last 2 'delta_t's being wrong in next step (One is extra, one is wrong).

1 (c): (1 pt) out of 2
For TD(0), when lambda=0, it will be 0^0 which is taken equal to 1, not 0.
Extra and wrong 'delta_t's = -1 as mentioned above.
So values are all wrong because of previous mistakes, although way of calculation is correct.

Delayed submission. (-2 pts)

2:
Correct!

You have done:
  while (i <= 200):
I don't think the number of states is 200. I think you considered possible values of the player's current sum and the dealer's one showing card, but did you consider the possible values of usable ace as well? That will easily double the total number of possible states. In any case, you have the exit condition in line 53:
  if done == True:
why not use that to terminate the while loop?
