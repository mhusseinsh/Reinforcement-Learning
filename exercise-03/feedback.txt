2:
Correct!

You have done:
  while (i <= 200):
I don't think the number of states is 200. I think you considered possible values of the player's current sum and the dealer's one showing card, but did you consider the possible values of usable ace as well? That will easily double the total number of possible states. In any case, you have the exit condition in line 53:
  if done == True:
why not use that to terminate the while loop?
