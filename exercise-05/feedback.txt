1: (-2 pts)

Line 46:
  self.y = tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected(self.fc2, env.action_space.n, activation_fn=None)
Why did you use self.y again? You used it already in line 38. And in line 85, you did:
  feed_dict = { self.x: states, self.actions: actions, self.y: targets }
You have mixed up what are the targets and what are the predictions. The targets are the true values/labels. The predictions are the output of the network.

Line 49:
  self.losses = tf.losses.mean_squared_error([all_actions], self.y, reduction =tf.losses.Reduction.NONE)
Why did you use all_actions? If self.y are your network's predictions, instead of all_actions you have to use the targets here (for which you should have declared self.targets in line 38 instead of self.y).

Line 50:
  self.loss = tf.reduce_mean(self.losses)
You don't have to do reduce_mean. You already took mean_squared_error in the previous step.

2 (a):
Correct!

2 (b):
For the use_experience_replay part, similar to approx.update(), you have to do target.update(), but you haven't done that. (-1 pt)
