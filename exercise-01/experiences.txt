Experiences

experience with this exercise:
- We could solve Exercise 2 quickler than exercise 1 because it was clear, and understandable.
  We also used our knowledge of AI as a complement for solving it; besides using the formulas presented in the lecture. 
  Therefore, we did not spend much time.
-Explanations and concept of the first question was not clear enough to understand it easily and start solving the question right after, specifically a), b) and c). 
 It took very long time to understand what to do despite all the talk about it at the lecture.  
-Exercise 1c was the one which we spend much time, because: 
 	At first, it was complicated to understand. 
	After asking to the tutors our specific doubts, then we could propose a solution.
  	However, the latter was also time consuming.
