1.2 (a):
Correct!

1.2 (b):
You said:
"It chooses the one with maximum, then moves to the next state."
It can update all states in parallel, it doesn't need to do it sequentially.

You said:
"On each new advancing on states"
It'd be better to say "on each iterative update" or something similar. I'm not sure "advancing" is the term used generally.

You said:
"But we need to advance only one time for the optimal policy,"
I didn't completely understand, but I think you meant that we can get the optimal policy in 1 update loop from the optimal value function. You've done it correctly in code anyway.
